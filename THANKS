Many thanks to Oskar Liljeblad for its original work on GMediaServer
(which is much more functionnal in terms of UPnP A/V features
that uShare will ever be).

Special Thanks to Rémi Turboult for some UPnP standard compliance check.

Thanks to Jason Woodward for making me aware of most of
DLNA specification internals.
